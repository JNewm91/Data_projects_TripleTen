# Data_projects_TripleTen
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 2 | This project analyzes Zomato’s performance using a Tableau dashboard, providing insights into key trends like revenue distribution, weekday sales patterns, and seasonal fluctuations. It highlights the dominance of top brands like Domino’s and KFC, as well as consumer behaviors tied to payday cycles and social habits. The dashboard allows for interactive exploration by cuisine, dietary preference, and city, offering a tailored view of how urbanization and market dynamics influence sales. Key recommendations include strengthening brand partnerships, enhancing customer engagement, and expanding into emerging urban markets. |
| 3 | NYC Airbnb | This report analyzes the Manhattan vacation rental market from 2009 to 2023, focusing on mid-range properties ($100–$1,500) with at least 15 recent reviews. Key findings highlight the Lower East Side, Hell's Kitchen, and Harlem as top neighborhoods, with 1-bedroom units most popular, except in Midtown where studios dominate. Mondays have the highest booking rates, offering weekday rental opportunities. Hell's Kitchen shows the highest revenue potential for 2-bedroom properties. The report recommends focusing on high-demand areas and property types to maximize investment returns. |
| 4 | Returns | This analysis reveals higher return rates in the Western U.S., despite uniform national sales, suggesting regional factors like consumer expectations. Returns peak on Sundays, with August purchases showing the highest return rates, possibly due to seasonal buying patterns. Machines, fasteners, and appliances have the highest return rates, while paper products have a high return count but low sales volume. The report recommends adjusting return policies and improving product quality based on these trends. The dashboard allows further exploration of return trends by category, region, and time to help optimize business strategies. |
| 5 | Retention Rates | This analysis looks at conversion and retention patterns on an e-commerce platform from September 2020 to February 2021. The conversion funnel shows a significant drop-off from product views to cart additions, though users who engage with the cart are more likely to purchase. Retention rates decline sharply across most cohorts, with slight increases in September and October 2020, suggesting potential for targeted marketing. Recommendations include optimizing the cart experience, implementing retention strategies, and analyzing cohort trends. Ongoing monitoring and incorporating more data variables will help refine strategies to improve conversion and retention. |
| 6 | Decomposition | This decomposition proposes the analysis of restaurant performances in the Zomato project above by examining key metrics like sales, customer ratings, and demographics. It explores factors influencing popularity and revenue, including cuisine type, location, and pricing, while tracking trends such as peak order days and seasonal variations. The findings are presented through an interactive dashboard featuring revenue summaries, top restaurant rankings, sales trends, and actionable recommendations for market opportunities, pricing strategies, and targeted promotions. |
