| 2 | Zomato Restaurant Analysis| This dashboard offers a detailed overview of Zomato’s performance metrics. Key insights include the highest-performing restaurants and their respective order volume as well as notable weekday sales patterns reflecting consumer behavior linked to social activities and workweek routines. Yearly trends show fluctuations influenced by seasonal preferences, while monthly sales reveal peaks around payday cycles. Additionally, urbanization and corporate presence drive sales in major cities like Delhi and Bangalore, highlighting opportunities for Zomato to optimize strategies across diverse consumer segments. |
| 3 | NYC Airbnb | This report analyzes the Manhattan vacation rental market from 2009 to 2023, focusing on mid-range properties ($100–$1,500) with at least 15 recent reviews. Key findings highlight the Lower East Side, Hell's Kitchen, and Harlem as top neighborhoods, with 1-bedroom units most popular, except in Midtown where studios dominate. Mondays have the highest booking rates, offering weekday rental opportunities. Hell's Kitchen shows the highest revenue potential for 2-bedroom properties. The report recommends focusing on high-demand areas and property types to maximize investment returns. |
| 4 | Returns | This analysis reveals higher return rates in the Western U.S., despite uniform national sales, suggesting regional factors like consumer expectations. Returns peak on Sundays, with August purchases showing the highest return rates, possibly due to seasonal buying patterns. Machines, fasteners, and appliances have the highest return rates, while paper products have a high return count but low sales volume. The report recommends adjusting return policies and improving product quality based on these trends. The dashboard allows further exploration of return trends by category, region, and time to help optimize business strategies. |
