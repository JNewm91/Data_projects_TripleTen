## Analysis Summary:

The data observed indicates that the Western United States exhibits a notably higher average return rate for items purchased from the Superstore compared to other regions, despite having a sales distribution that is relatively uniform with the rest of the country. This suggests there may be regional factors contributing to the increased return rate in this area.

Nationally, return volumes peak on Sundays across all categories, while Saturdays experience the lowest return volumes. Additionally, items purchased in August have the highest return rates throughout the year. In terms of product categories, machines, fasteners, and appliances show the highest average return rates. Notably, although paper products have a significantly high return count, their sales volume does not proportionally reflect this return rate.

## Speculations and Potential Causes:

* **Regional Factors**: The higher return rate in the Western United States might be due to specific regional characteristics such as higher consumer expectations, differences in return policies, or regional economic conditions influencing purchasing and return behaviors.
* **Timing of Returns**: The peak in returns on Sundays could be related to consumers evaluating their purchases over the weekend and deciding to return items before the end of the week. The low return volume on Saturdays might be influenced by customers' purchase decisions on Fridays or an inherent delay in return processing.
* **August Purchases**: The high return rate for items bought in August could be linked to seasonal factors, such as back-to-school shopping or end-of-summer sales, which might prompt more impulse buys that consumers later regret.
* **Product-Specific Issues**: The high return rates for machines, fasteners, and appliances might be attributed to issues with product functionality, customer dissatisfaction, or misalignment with consumer expectations. The significant return count for paper products, despite their lower sales volume, could suggest issues with product quality or packaging.

In conclusion, addressing these potential causes could involve refining return policies, improving product quality, and adjusting marketing strategies to align with regional consumer behavior patterns.

## Overview of Story Points:

* **Sales & Returns Based on Sub-Categories**: Though the relationship between total sales and total returns appears to be complex, we can see a generally positive trend with a large cluster of sub-categories focused around the lower values of each variable with many others increasing in returns as sales numbers grow. Notable outliers include copiers, chairs, and paper.

* **Average Return Rate by Category**: Furniture items and office supplies have similar averages for their return rate, just exceeding 25%, while technological items have a slightly higher general average of around 27%.

* **Average Return Rate by Customer**: There is a very steady trend of average returns based on different customers. Two have reliably returned every purchase with significant plateaus around 78%, 50%, 40%, 36%, 33%, and 23%.

* **Average Return Rate by State**: Through this visual, we can see that a high percentage of returns occur in the West, notably in Utah, California, and Oregon. Comparatively, the Central region has a relatively low return rate.

* **Average Return Rate by Month**: The average rate of returns begins to climb at the start of the year, but falls in February before plateauing between March and April. From there, the trend continues to decline into July, before drastically rising to its peak of roughly 39% in August. From here it declines somewhat significantly before drastically rising again from November to December.

* **Average Return Rate of Each Category by Weekday**: Through this visual, we can see Sunday as the most significant day for returns on average, with returns on technology at 43%, furniture at 40%, and office supplies at 32%. Conversely, Saturday has the lowest percentages with technology at 13%, furniture at 18%, and office supplies at 16%.

* **Average Return Rate of Sub-Category by Region**: We can see that on average, the items that are most prone to returns are appliances, fasteners, and machines in the West. Regionality is an important distinction in this context because both machines and office supplies have no returns in the South and very low returns in the Central region.
