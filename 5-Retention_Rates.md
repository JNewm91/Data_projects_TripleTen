## Analysis Summary of Retention Rates and Conversion Funnels for E-Commerce Company

This analysis examines the conversion rates and retention patterns of users engaging with an e-commerce platform over the timeline from September 24, 2020, to February 28, 2021. The primary objective is to identify trends in user behavior regarding their journey from initial product views to completed purchases, as well as their retention over time. Through a structured conversion funnel and cohort analysis, we aim to gain insights into user interactions and provide actionable recommendations to enhance customer retention and conversion efficiency.

**Conversion Funnel Analysis**:

The conversion funnel analysis reveals a gradual decline in overall conversion rates as users progress through different stages, from initial product views to final purchases. Notably, while there is a decrease in conversion from the first steps (views to adding items to the cart), a marked recovery is observed from "shopping cart" actions to actual purchases. This indicates that users who engage with the shopping cart are significantly more likely to complete their purchases.

Using pivot tables, we categorized users based on their first purchase date, event date, and cohort age, allowing for a clear understanding of user transitions through the funnel.

**Key Insights**:

1. **Initial Drop-off**: A significant number of users drop off between the initial product view and the addition of items to their cart, indicating a need for improved product engagement strategies.

2. **Recovery at Purchase**: The shopping cart serves as a critical juncture, with users who add items to their cart showing a high likelihood of completing their purchase.

**Retention Rates Analysis**:

Retention rates displayed a concerning trend, with a general decline across all cohorts. The notable exceptions were the cohorts starting in September 2020, which showed a slight increase from "Age 3" to "Age 4," and a similar plateau for the October cohort. This suggests that certain cohorts may benefit from targeted marketing efforts or seasonal promotions that extend customer engagement.

The raw data used for this analysis was filtered to focus on finalized purchases, with cohort ages determined by comparing the month of the first purchase to subsequent months of user engagement. The retention data illustrates that users from earlier cohorts tend to maintain engagement longer, with newer cohorts experiencing more rapid drop-offs.

**Key Insights**:

1. **Rapid Decline in Retention**: Most cohorts exhibited a sharp decrease in retention rates, falling to 0% sooner for newer cohorts, suggesting a need for proactive retention strategies.

2. **Cohort Age 3 Outlier**: The increase in retention from cohort age 3 to 4 indicates potential factors influencing customer loyalty that merit further investigation.

**Recommendations**:

1. **Optimize Cart Experience**: Since conversion from cart to purchase is relatively high, enhancing the shopping cart experience—such as streamlining the checkout process, offering personalized incentives (discounts, free shipping), and improving the user interface—could further boost conversion rates.

2. **Implement Targeted Retention Strategies**: Given the observed drop-off in retention, deploying targeted retention strategies (e.g., personalized follow-up emails, loyalty rewards, and re-engagement campaigns) could mitigate early disengagement and encourage repeat purchases.

3. **Analyze Cohort-Specific Trends**: Investigate the factors contributing to the retention spike in cohort age 3 to understand successful elements that can be applied to other cohorts. Analyzing seasonal promotions, targeted marketing efforts, or specific product offerings that resonated well could provide valuable insights.

4. **Broaden Data Variables**: While the current analysis focused on user ID, event type, and event date, incorporating additional variables such as product category, brand, and price in future analyses could yield deeper insights into customer preferences and behavior patterns.

5. **Establish Ongoing Monitoring**: Regular analysis of conversion and retention metrics is essential. Continuous monitoring enables agile adjustments to marketing strategies and user experience improvements based on real-time data.

**Conclusion**:

This analysis underscores the critical need for optimizing the conversion funnel and addressing retention challenges within user cohorts in the e-commerce landscape. By focusing on the key insights and implementing the recommendations provided, the e-commerce company can enhance user engagement, increase conversion rates, and ultimately improve retention, driving sustained growth and profitability.
